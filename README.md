 - Webpack | Parcel | Gulp have been used actively in most of the solutions.
 - CSS | HTML Sass preprocessor and BEM methodology to style HTML. Aware of nice new technologies like Tailwind CSS making it's way up. Moste actively used Foundation 6 but there have been others around like Gumby and Bootstrap.
 - Automation from a local development automation (linting, testing) to continuously integrating and deploying with cloud based CI/CD tools. Running Unit and Integration tests, sniffing code to check coding standards and building a project on cloud (CI/CD) after pushing to GitHub repository. That all right before the built project is deployed to WP Engine (Git Push) and notifying Slack channel on failures. Currently trying out a different deployment to WP Engine approach which is via SSH instead of Git Push https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-wordpress-to-wp-engine.
