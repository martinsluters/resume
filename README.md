Based in Latvia, Europe, I am a seasoned WordPress Engineer with a proven track record in crafting solutions since 2012. I am deeply passionate about developing solutions that empower individuals and businesses to streamline their processes, enhance performance, and simplify operations. Over the past 9 years, I have thrived in a 100% remote work environment, leveraging my expertise to contribute to diverse projects.

I actively engage with the WordPress community, regularly participating in meetups and WordCamps to stay abreast of the latest trends and innovations. Beyond the tech realm, I am a dedicated father and husband, cherishing moments with my dear family. My interests extend to action sports, particularly BMX racing, along with a love for reading, long walks, and embarking on new DIY projects.
