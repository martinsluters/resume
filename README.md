## Detailed Description of Skills

 - PHP is the primary expertise. I've been using it for 15 years and I regularly follow the latest improvements that come out with each version.

 - JS has been in the skill set for more than a decade. From plain Vanilla and jQuery to frameworks like Vue.js which has been a great help when reactivity is required. Couple of Vue.js examples: [https://www.stemhealthcare.com/current-vacancies/](https://www.stemhealthcare.com/current-vacancies/)  [https://www.edgeofexistence.org/explore-edge-species-country/](https://www.edgeofexistence.org/explore-edge-species-country/)  [https://www.monkeycasino.com/](https://www.monkeycasino.com/)
I would really love to get more production experience with React thus Gutenberg, Vue.js and modern JS in general.

 - Webpack | Parcel | Gulp Tools that have been used actively in all modern solutions. I would not say that I am the quickest in configuring Webpack but I can definitely do it when it's required.

 - CSS | HTML I've been using Sass preprocessor and BEM methodology to style HTML. I am aware of nice new technologies like Tailwind CSS making it's way up. Frontend has not been my speciality but I can definitely do that as well. I have been using Foundation 6 most actively but there have been others around like Gumby and Bootstrap.

 - Automation from a local development automation to continuously integrating and deploying with cloud based CI/CD tools - I am configuring those as far as my knowledge goes. Running Unit and Integration tests, sniffing code to check coding standards and building a project on cloud (CI/CD) after pushing to GitHub repository. That all right before the built project is deployed to WP Engine (Git Push) and notifying Slack channel on failures. Currently trying out a different deployment to WP Engine approach which is via SSH instead of Git Push https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-wordpress-to-wp-engine.
